				The bass pounding through the Throne tightens the iron vice on her skull, digging its claws into the
				bone and whittling away the remnants of coherent thoughts.
				<br>
				<br>
				She locates the Mods lounging on the white leather chaises, huddled amongst themselves.
				<br>
				They whisper conspiratorially – or perhaps she only imagines the silence that falls as her heels click
				in approach.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>“Ezri.”</b> The Mod splits his mouth into a grin. <b>“We were wondering if you would be returning
					after the…fiasco.”</b> MK’s lip curls.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>Ugh.</i> <b>“Of course.”</b> Her smile is equal parts teeth and tongue. <b>“I wouldn’t dream of
					letting a minor inconvenience ruin our celebration. After all, it’s barely past three.”</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				She gestures for another round of drinks to be served, the glass walls darkening at her command.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>“A toast.”</b> Ezri takes a flute from the platter and raises it. The transparent room suspended in
				the centre of The Void transforms itself into a black box. <b>“To the eve of our 7th anniversary!”</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>“To the eve!”</b> the Mods echo, downing the glasses one by one.
				<br>
				<br>
				Her lips kiss the rim, impressing a garnet stain. A languid smile takes its place as Ezri drops into a
				seat and easy conversation, stretching her arm over the top of the lounge to tip the untouched liquid
				into a potted plant. Ezri sets her alibi on a nearby table, nodding along to the words of her
				companions.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>“Can you believe it’s been seven years?”</b> AM exclaims, golden bangles jingling in excitement.
				<br>
				The fuschia sequins on her dress refract the strobing lights – so sharply that Ezri tilts her head,
				vision just grazing the milky curve of her cheek. Blissfully oblivious, AM flashes an equally blinding
				beam.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ezri chuckles. <b>“We haven’t been here <i>all</i> seven years.”</b>
