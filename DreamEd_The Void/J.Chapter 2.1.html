The moment his Oxfords click against the polished marble, Jaz tenses. Though no stranger to Avaire’s host of casinos – far from it, in fact – he scrunches his nose as he enters, attributing it to the gaudy décor and clouds of overpriced cologne that permeate the place; the undecipherable, lingering sensation in his chest is shoved aside for the time being.
<br>
<br>
Jaz flexes his fingers and rolls his neck, determined to restrain his attention to the task at hand. Steeling himself against the siren songs of slot levers, chips, and chimes of accounts filling up, he swallows, averting his gaze just as the miniscule light on his ring flashes green. Relieved for the distraction, he opens the message with a flick of his hand.
<br>

Meet me at the cards table.

<br>
<b>“Bastard,”</b> Jaz mutters, making his way to the furthest end of the casino. 
<br>The infamous poker table lies vacant, its typical crowds thinned by the post-midnight rush, bare of any indication of the countless dollars and bouts of control surrendered mere hours before.
<br>
<br>
He takes a seat, drumming his fingers against the velvet surface.
<br>
<br>
There's an itch as he follows the dealer's hands — the cards moving like water between their fingers, shuffled, then placed neatly beside the stacks of chips, awaiting a player's bet.
<br>
<br>
A woman situates herself at the opposite end of the table, platinum hair curled in pristine waves atop her shoulders. Her sequined dress reflects the sparse, warm lights of the corner onto the table, glinting nearly as bright as the teeth beneath her vulpine smile.
<br>
<br>
The dealer turns toward him. "In or out, sir?"
